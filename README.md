# TAG (HEC Paris X Tezos Hackaton)
ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd palce 

## Descrition
How our web 2.5 networking solution won us second place at the HEC Paris X Tezos hackathon ðŸš€

Developing your network is crucial in any type of event, but it's still very laborious ðŸ‘‡
- Everyone has their own preferred method of contact: Twitter, Linkedin, Discord... You have to agree and sometimes accept a different method.
- Exchanging contact is slow, opening the application, spelling out your username, checking your account... We prefer to avoid these awkward, time-consuming situations with people with whom the stakes are high.
- And even though the exchange is quick, a week later, I've added 20 people and I don't know who's who, or why I added them.

With TAG, you can scan or "tag" the contact of a person you meet to get all their communication methods, favorite social networks, their web2 profile as well as their web3 profile where you'll find all the proof of their achievements thanks to on-chain data. No more imposters on LinkedIn ðŸ˜‰ 

When you retrieve a person's tag, you can make a note of why the person interests you. That way, once the event has passed, exploring your tag catalog will allow you to see exactly why you tagged a person. ðŸ“–

And of course, for those who don't want to get doxxed, ZK proofs are used to avoid revealing your wallet when displaying information. ðŸ¤«

Connection to the app is via Twitter to promote onboarding for web3 users who don't have their wallet on their phone, but also for those coming from web2 without any blockchain knowledge! ðŸ’¡

Anyone can use TAG, everyone needs to develop their network. ðŸš€
